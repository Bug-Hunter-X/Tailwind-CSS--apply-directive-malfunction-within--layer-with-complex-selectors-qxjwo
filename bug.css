The issue lies in the usage of Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a `@layer` directive.  When using `@apply` inside `@layer` with a complex selector, Tailwind might not properly process and apply the styles. This often results in unexpected behavior where styles are either not applied or are applied incorrectly.
