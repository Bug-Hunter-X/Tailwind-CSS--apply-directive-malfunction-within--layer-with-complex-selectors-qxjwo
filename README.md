# Tailwind CSS @apply Issue within @layer Directive

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a `@layer` directive, particularly with more complex selectors.  The problem is that Tailwind may not properly process and apply the styles in these situations, leading to unexpected styling outcomes.

**Problem:** Styles defined using `@apply` inside a `@layer` with complex selectors might not be applied correctly or at all.

**Solution:** The solution involves refactoring the CSS to avoid overly complex selectors within the `@apply` directive or re-evaluating the use of the `@layer` directive itself.  This might involve moving styles to a more straightforward class or creating separate utility classes.

* `bug.css`: Demonstrates the problematic code.
* `bugSolution.css`: Shows the corrected code.
